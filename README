A barebones L1 compiler for 15-411 written in Rust.

===========

This compiler is a Cargo crate, and should be built as such with `cargo build`
or it can be run with `cargo run path/to/input.l1`. You can pass additional
flags with `cargo run path/to/input.l1 -- --your-flag`. To build with
optimizations, run `cargo build --release`.

The crate is broken up into the following files/directories:
- src/main.rs   Toplevel runtime for the compiler
- src/parse/    AST and lexer/parser
- src/types     Typechecker
- src/ir/       IR language and translator
- src/codegen/  Assembly representation, code generation, register allocation
- src/util/     Various utilities used across parts of the code

===========

Notes on using Rust for your compiler:

- There are no good graph libraries. This is a good resource for implementing
  graphs in rust: github.com/nrc/r4cppp/blob/master/graphs/README.md

- Don't use thread_local! any more than you must. Globals are bad, and only
  used in the parser due to the constraints of the parser generator.

- Instead of manually adding a verbose flag or similar feature, you should
  consider using the log package: doc.rust-lang.org/log/log/index.html
